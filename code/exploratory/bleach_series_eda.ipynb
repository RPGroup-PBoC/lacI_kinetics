Before we make decisions about switching to a new scope set up, we should repeat this test with better focus & see if the spot intensities are less variable. If they are less variable, we're probably best off staying with the Nikon & time-sharing. If they are still quite variable, we probably want to consider switching to a repurposed TPM Olympus so we can clean up the illumination beam w/ some combo of multimode fiber, diffuser, and lens array. The lack of PFS would suck, but it's not instantly a dealbreaker.\n",
